## Introduction to graphs

Graph:

A graph G is an ordered pair of a set V of vertices and a set E of edges.

ordered pair: `(a, b) != (b, a)`

unordered pair: `{a, b} = {b, a}`

Edges:

directed `u -> v` 

undirected `u - v`

Directed Graph - Undirected Graph

We can draw an Undirected Graph as directed, but not vice versa

## Properties of Graphs

- Self-loop

- Multiedge
